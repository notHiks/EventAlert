It looks as if it was erroring when it was trying to pre-load spells that didn't exist to the player (the character was too low in level and didn't have the spell or didn't have it trained.)

4.0.3 - Added a version check option to the slash commands.  (/ea ver -or- /ea version)
  Bugfix:  Fixed bug where frames wouldn't close when using the ESC key.
           Note: Because the mod can now show more than one proc, some people may not like this function.  It is now an option in the options pane.  Note that it requires a reload of the UI after changing the option.
